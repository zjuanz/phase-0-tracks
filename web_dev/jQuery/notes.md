# Release 0: Make a Plan

>Spend 10 minutes making a plan for how you intend to tackle jQuery and learn as much as you can in two hours. What sorts of resources will help? How often should you stop and test what you just learned? Are breaks important? Make a few notes in the file on how you plan to approach the topic, and why.
## Plan
- [ ] look up definition for jQuery
    - [x] [jQuery] (https://jquery.com) web site
    jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers.
    - [x] [Ajax] (http://www.seguetech.com/ajax-technology/)
    Ajax is a client-side script that communicates to and from a server/database without the need for a postback or a complete page refresh. The best definition I've read for Ajax is “the method of exchanging data with a server, and updating parts of a web page – without reloading the entire page.”Mar 12, 2013
    - [ ] [JSON] (http://www.seguetech.com/xml-vs-json-based-web-services-which-is-the-best-choice/)
    - [ ] [web services]
    - [ ] [SOAP]
- [ ] look for best jQuery cheat sheets

# Release 1: Study up
Definitely went down a bit of a rabbit hole and should have been 
serious about time bounding the exercise. The Learning center turned
out to be very thorough but probably more detail than needed for a 
jQuery overview. 
Fairly quickly found try.jquery.com and decided to switch to 
that for the next release.
Biggest takeaway was I should have reviewed my plan/thinking 
with someone else (almost anyone else!) before jumping in...

# Release 2: Make a thing
Made it to [Level 3] (http://try.jquery.com/levels/3/challenges/1) 
in Code School (see screen shot PNG)
