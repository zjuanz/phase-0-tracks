1. In phase-0-tracks/web_dev/request_cycle create a Markdown file called http_requests.md. Research the following questions and record your answers in that file.
2. What are some common HTTP status codes?
- 200 ==> OK
- 404 ==> Not Found
- 500 ==> INTERNAL SERVER ERROR
- 403 ==> FORBIDDEN
- 401 ==> UNAUTHORIZED
- 400 ==> BAD REQUEST
3. What is the difference between a GET request and a POST request? When might each be used?
- GET:is attempting to get some resource
- POST: is sending data to be processed
- you would use GET when you are looking something up and a POST when you are updating something on the server
4. Optional bonus question: What is a cookie (the technical kind, not the delicious kind)? How does it relate to HTTP requests?
- a cookie is a piece of data that is saved by a web browser to remember stuff between/beyond individual web pages. When an HTTP request is made, it also includes any associated cookies.
