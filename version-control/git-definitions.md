# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
    - keeps lots of copies of a file as it evolves
    - allows you to back up if needed
    - also allows you to have several changes in mid flight on the same file
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
    - a separate set of changes
    - allows for multiple changes to be in the works at the same time
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
    - establishes a tracking point for a specific version of file(s)
    - enough details to give a good idea of what the changes are
* What is a merge conflict?
    - when two different branches change the same part of code
